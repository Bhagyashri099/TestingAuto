Feature: User Management API
    #@skip_setup1
  Scenario Outline: Create multiple users and log results to Excel
    Given I have the Excel sheet ready at row "<rowNum>"
    When I send a POST request using data from Excel row "<rowNum>"
    Then the status code should be 200
    When I send a GET request using the extracted ID
    Then the response should contain the name "John"
   Then I save the generated ID and status back to row <rowNum>    
    Examples:
    |rowNum|
    |1|
